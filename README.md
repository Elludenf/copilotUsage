# Boosting Node.js Performance with GitHubÂ Copilot

By Patricio Perez

## Introduction

Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building scalable and high-performance web applications. While it offers excellent performance, we at Ballast Lane are always seeking ways to optimize our code further. Enter GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool that can revolutionize your development process. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Copilot to improve the performance of your Node.js applications, helping you build faster and more efficient code.

## Understanding Performance Optimization

Knowing how to write good performant code is challenging, here are some considerations:

* Latency: Latency is the time it takes for a request to be processed by your application. A low latency means that your application is responsive and provides a good user experience. Identifying Performance Bottlenecks such as intensive tasks, memory leaks, and inefficient I/O operations is key.

* CPU usage: CPU usage is the percentage of time that the CPU is busy executing your application's code. A high CPU usage can indicate that your application is inefficient and could benefit from optimization.

* Memory usage: Memory usage is the amount of memory that your application is using. A high memory usage can indicate that your application is leaking memory or using too much for its needs.

* Disk I/O: The amount of disk I/O that your application performs can also impact performance. If your application is reading or writing a lot of data to disk, you may be able to improve performance by using a different storage strategy or by optimizing your application's code.

* Error rate: The error rate is the percentage of requests that result in an error. A high error rate can indicate that there are problems with your application's code or that it is not handling errors gracefully.

* Database queries: The number of database queries that your application makes can impact performance. If your application is making a lot of unnecessary database queries, you may be able to improve performance by caching data or using a different database strategy.

* Network traffic: The amount of network traffic that your application generates can also impact performance. If your application is transferring a lot of data over the network, you may be able to improve performance by using a content delivery network (CDN) or by optimizing your application's code.

## How can you use Copilot to improve Node.js performance?

### 1. Suggesting more efficient code

Copilot can suggest more efficient code by using its knowledge of the Node.js runtime to understand how different code paths perform.For example, Copilot might suggest using a more efficient algorithm for a particular task, or it might suggest using a different data structure to improve performance.

**Example**:

![ShowCase](/ImproveCodePerformance.gif)

***Prompmt***: /fix help me out improving the performance of this function

``` javascript
// Old function
const getAllUsersWithPosts = async () => {
    const allUsers = await User.findAll(); // Fetching all users from the database
    const usersWithPosts = [];
  
    for (let i = 0; i < allUsers.length; i++) {
      const user = allUsers[i];
      const posts = await Post.findAll({ where: { userId: user.id } }); // Fetching posts for each user
      user.posts = posts; // Adding posts to the user object
      usersWithPosts.push(user);
    }
  
    return usersWithPosts;
  };
```

``` javascript
// New function
const getAllUsersWithPosts = async () => {
  const usersWithPosts = await User.findAll({
    include: [{ model: Post }],
  });

  return usersWithPosts;
};
```

***Conclusion***: The new function is more efficient because it uses a single query to fetch all users and their posts, instead of making multiple queries to fetch each user's posts individually. This example highlights the importance of utilizing the ORM's capabilities for handling relationships and performing join operations efficiently. By doing so, we can optimize database queries, minimize the number of queries executed, and improve the overall performance of the application.

### 2. Identifying potential performance bottlenecks

Copilot can identify potential performance bottlenecks by analyzing the code for areas that are computationally expensive.For example, Copilot might suggest using a caching mechanism to reduce the number of times a particular function is called, or it might suggest using a different algorithm for a particular task.

***Example 1***: Let's say we have a case where we have a function that is called multiple times and is heavy. We can use Copilot to help us identify the bottleneck and suggest a caching mechanism to reduce the number of times the function is called.

``` javascript
// Inefficient code: Retrieving user details from an external API without memoization

const fetchUserDetails = async (userId) => {
  const userDetails = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  const data = await userDetails.json();
  return data;
};

```

![Bottleneck1](/Bottleneck1.gif)

***Prompt***: /fix improve latency for this function to improve performance

![Bottleneck2](/Bottleneck2.gif)

``` javascript
// Efficient code: Retrieving user details from an external API with memoization using a Map

const userDetailsCache = new Map();

const fetchUserDetails = async (userId) => {
  if (userDetailsCache.has(userId)) {
    return userDetailsCache.get(userId);
  }

  const userDetails = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  const data = await userDetails.json();
  userDetailsCache.set(userId, data);
  return data;
};
```

**Reasoning**: The new function is more efficient because it uses a `Map` to cache the results of previous API calls. This reduces the number of times the API is called, which improves performance.

_________________

**Example 2**: Let's say you have an Express.js API endpoint that fetches data from multiple external APIs and performs some computation before sending the response. Copilot can suggest improvements to optimize the code. Here's an example:

``` javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');

const app = express();

app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const data1 = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data1');
    const data2 = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data2');
    const processedData = processData(data1, data2);
    res.json(processedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});

function processData(data1, data2) {
  // Perform computation on data1 and data2
  // ...
  return processedData;
}
```

**Prompt**: /fix identify possible performance bottlenecks and fix this code

![Bottleneck3](/Bottleneck3.gif)

**Conclusion**: The new function is more efficient because it uses a `Promise.all()` to fetch data from multiple APIs in parallel. This reduces the amount of time it takes to fetch the data, which improves performance.

### 3. Helping to prevent errors

Copilot can help to prevent errors by suggesting code that is correct and idiomatic. For example, Copilot might suggest using the correct syntax for a particular construct, or it might suggest using a more robust error handling mechanism.

**Example 1**:  In this example, we have a function called `readLargeFile` that reads a large file using the fs.readFile function from the Node.js built-in fs module. However, this approach can lead to performance issues when dealing with large files because it reads the entire file into memory at once.

``` javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function readLargeFile(filePath) {
  fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error reading file:', err);
      return;
    }

    console.log(data);
  });
}

readLargeFile('/path/to/large/file.txt');

```

**Prompt**: /fix Fix this function is taking forever to read a file

![Prevent1](./streams.gif)

**Conclusion**: In this improved version, we use `fs.createReadStream` to create a readable stream that reads the file in chunks, and then we listen for the 'data' event to process each chunk as it becomes available. This approach is more memory-efficient and performs better when dealing with large files.

_________________

**Example 2**: Let's imagine you're building a RESTful API using the Express framework. You want to implement a route that fetches user information from a database and returns it as a JSON response. You start writing the code but encounter some challenges in handling errors and asynchronous operations.

``` javascript
const express = require('express');
const User = require('../models/User');

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  User.findById(req.params.id, (err, user) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error fetching user:', err);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
      return;
    }
    if (!user) {
      res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
      return;
    }
    res.json(user);
  });
});

module.exports = router;

```

***Prompt***: /fix I am having issues handling errors help me fix this code When the api fails the errors are not sent back to the API

![errorHandling](/errorHandling.gif)

***Conclusion***: The new function is more robust because it uses a try/catch block to handle errors and it uses async/await to handle asynchronous operations. This makes the code easier to read and maintain. Copilot suggests using a try-catch block to handle potential errors that may occur during the `User.findById` operation. This helps ensure that errors are properly caught and handled, preventing unhandled promise rejections.

### 4. Security and caveats

Copilot can help you review potential security vulnerabilities in code or SQL queries, thereby identifying possible sql injections.

**Example**:  For a query where we are concatenating the user input to the query string, Copilot can help us to prevent sql injections by suggesting secure code.

**Prompt**: /fix help me out checking and fixing sql vulnerabilities

![Prompt](/Security%20-Vulnerabilities%20-SQL.gif)

**Conclusion**: The new function is more secure because it uses a parameterized query instead of concatenating the user input to the query string. This prevents SQL injection attacks.

### 5. Reducing code complexity

This refers to how difficult it is to understand, maintain, and test a piece of code. It is often used as a metric to identify potential areas of risk in software projects.
Copilot can help make more robust functions and chunk down complex functions with the right prompt.

**Example**: We have a function on a repository which queries the database for all the customers on a VIEW. This is a helper function to find paginated records and filters based on either "input" column fields or a "search "keyword. Current complexity point 13 according to the CodeMetrics plugin in VsCode.

**Prompt**: /fix help me out chucking this code into smaller functions

![Prompt](/Chunk_Function_Prompt.gif)

**Conclusion**: It created 4 additional functions making it easier to read and maintain, and now the main function has only 4 complexity points.
